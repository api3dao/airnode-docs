::: tip API3 Market

Using a proxy contract from the [API3 Market](https://market.api3.org) is the
preferred method to call dAPIs.

:::

This guide will use a simple workspace in the Remix IDE created from a GitHub
gist. You will deploy a simple smart contract onto the Polygon Mumbai testnet
that calls a dAPI proxy contract created on the [API3 Market](). This is the
preferred method to call a dAPI.

With proxy contracts from the API3 Market you can acquire the value of a dAPI
such as AVAX/USD. Each proxy contract is tied to a single dAPI. This allows
dAPIs to be used like libraries.

## Load the Remix workspace
