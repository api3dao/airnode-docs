The `config.json` defines a single Airnode deployment. The file contents are a
single JSON object. Each config object can be thought of as the static NoSQL
database of an Airnode deployment. It contains five fields as show below.

```json
{
  "chains": [],
  "nodeSettings": {},
  "triggers": {},
  "templates": [],
  "ois": [],
  "apiCredentials": []
}
```

- [chains](/reference/airnode/v0.13/deployment-files/config-json.md#chains):
  Blockchains the Airnode deployment will serve on and configuration details
- [nodeSettings](/reference/airnode/v0.13/deployment-files/config-json.md#nodesettings):
  General deployment parameters such as node version and deployment
  configuration.
- [triggers](/reference/airnode/v0.13/deployment-files/config-json.md#triggers):
  Which on-chain endpoints will be usable by which an available protocol
  (currently only RRP) and under what endpoint ID.
- [templates](/reference/airnode/v0.13/deployment-files/config-json.md#templates):
- [ois](/reference/airnode/v0.13/deployment-files/config-json.md#ois): API
  specifications and the corresponding on-chain endpoints, kept as
  [OIS](/reference/ois/2.2/specification.md) objects.
- [apiCredentials](/reference/airnode/v0.13/deployment-files/config-json.md#apicredentials):
  Which API credentials will be usable by which OIS and security scheme.

## chains

Lists the blockchains the Airnode deployment will serve on and specifies
respective parameters.

### `authorizers`

(required) - An object containing `authorizers` scheme types that contain
authorizer contract addresses specifying the auth patterns that the
[AirnodeRrpV0](/reference/airnode/v0.13/concepts/#airnoderrpv0-sol) contract
should use on-chain. Learn more about authorizers in
[Authorizers](/reference/airnode/v0.13/concepts/authorizers.md) and
[Using Authorizers](/reference/airnode/v0.13/understand/apply-auth.md).

### `authorizations`

(required) - An object containing `authorizations` scheme types that contain
authorized endpointId/address pairs where the address is that of a requester.
Airnode uses these pairs to determine access to its endpoints during its run
cycle off-chain. Nothing in `authorizers` can supersede permissions granted by
`authorizations` as they take precedence. Learn more about authorizations in
[Authorizations](/reference/airnode/v0.13/concepts/authorizations.md) and
[Using Authorizations](/reference/airnode/v0.13/understand/using-authorizations.md).

### `contracts`

(conditionally optional) - An object that keeps the addresses of the protocol
contracts deployed on the respective chain. Currently this object has one member
field corresponding to the `AirnodeRrp` contract address. The `contracts` object
may be omitted if there is an existing API3 `AirnodeRrpV0` deployment for the
respective chain, in which case Airnode will default to using this address. A
full listing of deployments can be found [here](/reference/airnode/v0.13/).

### `id`

(required) - The corresponding chain (or network) ID. If this is an
Ethereum-based chain, `id` should be the chain ID as described in
[EIP-155](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-155.md#list-of-chain-ids).
Refer to the documentations of the chain you will be using to find its chain ID.
Supported chains are listed under
[Airnode Contract Addresses](/reference/airnode/v0.13/).

### `providers`

(required) - An object specifying one or more providers. Each provider object
has an arbitrary name field and an object as a value. The value for the `url`
field within this inner object specifies the url of the chain provider. It is
generally recommended to provide the `url` value via interpolation from
`secrets.env`. Also note that each provider name should be unique. For more see
[Chain Providers](/reference/airnode/v0.13/concepts/chain-providers.md).

### `type`

(required) - The type of chain. Currently only `evm` is supported.

### `options`

(required) - An object that configures chain-related options. See
[Configuring an Airnode](/reference/airnode/v0.13/understand/configuring.md#chains)
for some considerations.

#### `options.fulfillmentGasLimit`

(optional) - The maximum gas limit allowed when Airnode responds to a request,
paid by the requester. If specified, this value will be used as the gas limit
for the fulfillment. Note that if the gas cost exceeds the limit given, the
request will be marked as failed and will not be retried during the next cycle.
If not specified, Airnode will attempt to estimate the gas limit automatically.

#### `options.withdrawalRemainder`

(optional) - An object of the form `{"value": 0, "unit": "wei"}` that configures
the amount to subtract from the funds returned to the sponsor when making a
[withdrawal](/reference/airnode/v0.13/concepts/sponsor.md#withdrawals). Defaults
to zero and is relevant only for some chains (e.g.
[Optimism](/reference/airnode/v0.13/chain-idiosyncrasies.md#optimism)).

##### `options.withdrawalRemainder.value`

<p style="margin-left:35px;">(required:<span style="font-size:small;color:gray;"> <code>if option.withdrawalRemainder present</code></span>) - A number specifying the <code>withdrawalRemainder</code> value.</p>

##### `options.withdrawalRemainder.unit`

<p style="margin-left:35px;">(required:<span style="font-size:small;color:gray;"> <code>if withdrawalRemainder present</code></span>) - The unit of the <code>withdrawalRemainder</code> value. It can be one of the following:
(wei, kwei, mwei, gwei, szabo, finney, ether).</p>

#### `options.gasPriceOracle[n]`

(required) - A list of gas price oracle strategies that the Airnode will use in
the specified order. Each strategy has its own unique set of associated fields
that describes it.

::: info Note

It does not make sense to mix and match eip1559 and non-eip1559 strategies
though it can be done. See
[<span style="color: rgb(16, 185, 129)">Gas Price Strategies</span>](/reference/airnode/v0.13/concepts/gas-prices.md)
in Concepts and Definitions for a better understanding of gas strategies.

and limiting
([AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/operatorguide/reserved-concurrency.html),
[GCP](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/configuring/max-instances)) the
number of spawned cloud functions based on this field.

If you want to disable this behavior, see
[disableConcurrencyReservations](/reference/airnode/v0.13/deployment-files/config-json.md#cloudprovider-disableconcurrencyreservations).

See
[Configuring an Airnode](/reference/airnode/v0.13/understand/configuring.md#considerations-concurrency)
for additional considerations.

    "maxConcurrency": 20,
    "corsOrigins": []
  },
  "httpSignedDataGateway": {
    "enabled": true,
    "maxConcurrency": 20,
    "corsOrigins": []
  },
  "oevGateway": {
    "enabled": true,
    "maxConcurrency": 20,
    "corsOrigins": []
  },
  "logFormat": "json",
  "logLevel": "INFO"
}
```

### `cloudProvider`

(required) - The cloud provider that the node will be deployed at and its
configuration. Learn more about AWS or GCP resources that Airnode uses in the
[Cloud Resources](/reference/airnode/v0.13/cloud-resources.md) documentation.

#### `cloudProvider.type`

(required) - Currently `aws` and `gcp` are supported for serverless
([deployer-image](/reference/airnode/v0.13/docker/deployer-image.md)). Use
`local` to run Airnode as a docker container locally
([client-image](/reference/airnode/v0.13/docker/client-image.md)).

#### `cloudProvider.region`

(required:<span style="font-size:small;color:gray">
`if cloudProvider.type is AWS or GCP`</span>) - The cloud provider region that
Airnode will be deployed to. An example AWS value would be `us-east-1` and an
example GCP value would be `us-east1`. See the cloud provider's documentation
for possible values, though not all regions can be deployed to. For GCP, make
sure to choose a **region** and not a zone. See the
[list of regions](/reference/airnode/v0.13/cloud-resources.md#supported-regions)
that have been confirmed to work. For AWS, some regions are disabled by default
and you must
[enable them](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html)
before you can create and manage resources. Note that transferring a deployment
from one region to the other is not trivial (i.e., it does not take one command
like deployment, but rather three) and is not advised.

#### `cloudProvider.disableConcurrencyReservations`

(required:<span style="font-size:small;color:gray">
`if cloudProvider.type is AWS or GCP`</span>) - Disables concurrency
reservations for spawned cloud functions. For more information refer to the

(optional:<span style="font-size:small;color:gray">
`if cloudProvider.type is local`</span>) - The port number (defaults to `3000`)
of the API gateway inside the docker container. This property is especially
useful, if the container is run using
[host networking](https://docs.docker.com/network/host/).

### `airnodeWalletMnemonic`

(required) - The wallet mnemonic that will be used as the Airnode's BIP 44
wallet from which the Airnode's
[address](/reference/airnode/v0.13/concepts/airnode.md#airnodeaddress) will be
derived. It is not required to fund the wallet to run the Airnode but must be
funded to announce the [xpub](/reference/airnode/v0.13/concepts/airnode.md#xpub)
of the Airnode on-chain which is optional.

### `heartbeat`

(required) - Object configuring Airnode's heartbeat functionality. Airnode can
periodically make a request to the specified URL signaling that it's active at
the end of each cycle (every minute). There are plans in the future to allow the

documentation for more info.

#### `httpGateway.enabled`

(required) - Enable or disable, using `true` or `false`, Airnode's access to the
HTTP gateway.

#### `httpGateway.maxConcurrency`

(required: <span style="font-size:small;color:gray;">
`if httpGateway.enabled is true`</span>) - A number higher than zero
representing the maximum number of serverless functions serving HTTP gateway
requests running at the same time. When omitted, there is no maximum concurrency
set.

#### `httpGateway.corsOrigins`

(required: <span style="font-size:small;color:gray;">
`if httpGateway.enabled is true`</span>) - A list of allowed origins. An empty
array (`[]`) can be used to disable CORS and the wildcard (`['*']`) can be used
to allow all origins.

auction. See the
[OEV Gateway](/reference/airnode/v0.13/understand/oev-gateway.md) documentation
for more info.

#### `oevGateway.enabled`

(required) - Enable or disable, using `true` or `false`, the OEV gateway.

#### `oevGateway.maxConcurrency`

(required: <span style="font-size:small;color:gray;">
`if oevGateway.enabled is true`</span>) - A number higher than zero representing
the maximum number of serverless functions serving OEV gateway requests running
at the same time. When omitted, there is no maximum concurrency set.

#### `oevGateway.corsOrigins`

(required: <span style="font-size:small;color:gray;">
`if oevGateway.enabled is true`</span>) - A list of allowed origins. An empty

[Releases page of the Airnode repo](https://github.com/api3dao/airnode/releases)
for available versions.

### `stage`

(required) - The label used to distinguish between multiple deployments of the
same Airnode on a cloud provider. For example, the same Airnode may have
multiple deployments with `stage` set to a different value (dev, public, prod).

alphanumeric characters (`a–z`, `0–9`) and hyphens (`-`).

## triggers

An array that maps external triggers such as a request made through RRP (or a
subscription made through PSP, which is not implemented yet) to an endpoint
defined in an OIS.

```json
// triggers
{
  "rrp": [
    {
      "endpointId": "0xd7ddc8ee64d6e540682ec844a5dd9737663ec3afe5751102eb4f966744751838",
      "oisTitle": "myOisTitle",
      "endpointName": "myEndpointName",
      "cacheResponses": false
    }
  ],
  "http": [
    {
      "endpointId": "0xd7ddc8ee64d6e540682ec844a5dd9737663ec3afe5751102eb4f966744751838",
      "oisTitle": "myOisTitle",
      "endpointName": "myEndpointName"
    }
  ],
  "httpSignedData": [
    {
      "endpointId": "0xd7ddc8ee64d6e540682ec844a5dd9737663ec3afe5751102eb4f966744751838",
      "oisTitle": "myOisTitle",
      "endpointName": "myEndpointName"
    }
  ]
}
```

In the example above, the Airnode deployment has an OIS with the title
`myOisTitle`. This OIS has an endpoint with the name `myEndpointName`. When the
Airnode deployment detects a
[request](/reference/airnode/v0.13/concepts/request.md) that references its
[`airnodeAddress`](/reference/airnode/v0.13/concepts/airnode.md#airnodeaddress)
and
<code style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">0xd7ddc8ee64d6e540682ec844a5dd9737663ec3afe5751102eb4f966744751838</code>
as the [`endpointId`](/reference/airnode/v0.13/concepts/endpoint.md#endpointid),
it will call the specified endpoint (`myOisTitle`-`myEndpointName`) with the
parameters provided in the request to fulfill it. See the
[endpointId documentation](/reference/airnode/v0.13/concepts/endpoint.md#endpointid)
for `endpointId` derivation instructions.

### `rrp`

(required) - An array of endpoints from OIS that the Airnode will respond to via
the RRP protocol [AirnodeRrpV0.sol](/reference/airnode/v0.13/concepts/).

#### `rrp[n].endpointId`

(required) - A identifier derived for an oisTitle/endpointName pair. For

## templates

An array that includes the necessary information to make
[Template Requests](/reference/airnode/v0.13/concepts/request.md#template-request).
The `templates` array must be included in the `config.json` file. The array can
be left empty if no templates are used . Valid templates will be used to make
template requests without calling the contract to fetch the template from the
chain. For details see
[Using Templates](/reference/airnode/v0.13/developers/using-templates.md).

```json
// templates
[
  {
    "templateId": "0x02834eb43d56133982b7d6e5aa8b466c7ea4ba0fadf697698c1fee0996bba0fc",
    "endpointId": "0xd9e8c9bcc8960df5f954c0817757d2f7f9601bd638ea2f94e890ae5481681153",
    "encodedParameters": "0x3173000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000636f696e49640000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000657468657265756d000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
  }
]
```

### `templateId`

(required: <span style="font-size:small;color:gray;">
`for each row in templates`</span>) - An identifier derived by hashing the
Airnode address, the endpointId and the encoded parameters of the template. For
derivation see:
[Templates](/reference/airnode/v0.13/concepts/template.md#templateid).

### `endpointId`

(required: <span style="font-size:small;color:gray;">
`for each row in templates`</span>) - An identifier derived for an
oisTitle/endpointName pair. For derivation see:
[derive-endpoint-id](/reference/airnode/v0.13/packages/admin-cli.md#derive-endpoint-id).

### `encodedParameters`

(required: <span style="font-size:small;color:gray;">
`for each row in templates`</span>) - The encoded request parameters.

## ois

A list of OIS objects. Since each OIS specifies the integration of an API to an
oracle, a single Airnode deployment can serve multiple APIs. To avoid
duplication of content, see the
[API Integration](/reference/airnode/v0.13/understand/api-integration.md) guide
and the [Oracle Integration Specifications (OIS)](/reference/ois/2.2/)
documentation.

## apiCredentials

Each entry in `apiCredentials` maps to a security scheme defined in an OIS
(`ois[n].components.securitySchemes.{securitySchemeName}`), where `oisTitle` is
the `title` field of the related OIS, and `securitySchemeName` is the name of
the respective security scheme. These would be `myOisTitle` and
`mySecurityScheme` in the example below. `securitySchemeValue` is the value used
for the authentication with the security scheme (e.g., the API key) which would
be in `secrets.env` in the example below. For more implementation details, see
the [API Security](/reference/airnode/v0.13/understand/api-security.md)
documentation.

The `security` field in the OIS object must be included and hold the names of
all security schemes the API operation

Note that if you do not need a security scheme, leave the `apiCredentials` array
empty.

```json
// apiCredentials
[
  {
    "oisTitle": "myOisTitle",
    "securitySchemeName": "mySecurityScheme",
    "securitySchemeValue": "${SS_MY_API_KEY}"
  }
]

// components and security field in OIS object
{
"title": "myOisTitle",
...,
"components": {
  "securitySchemes": {
    "mySecurityScheme": {
      "in": "header",
      "type": "apiKey",
      "name": "X-api-key"
    }
  }
},
"security": {
  "mySecurityScheme" []
}
...
}
```

### `oisTitle`

(required: <span style="font-size:small;color:gray;">
`for each row in apiCredentials`</span>) - The `ois.title` of the OIS where the
`securitySchemeName` can be found.

### `securitySchemeName`

(required: <span style="font-size:small;color:gray;">
`for each row in apiCredentials`</span>) - The name of a security scheme from
`ois[n].components.securitySchemes.{securitySchemeName}`.

### `securitySchemeValue`

(required: <span style="font-size:small;color:gray;">
`for each row in apiCredentials`</span>) - The value of the security scheme used
(as defined by `ois[n].components.securitySchemes.{securitySchemeName}` for the
authentication. Usually stored in `secrets.env`.
