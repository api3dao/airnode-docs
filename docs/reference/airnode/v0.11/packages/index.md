Airnode is a fully-serverless oracle node that is designed specifically for API
providers to operate their own oracles. Its code base is a monorepo managed
using [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna). The
[Airnode monorepo](https://github.com/api3dao/airnode/tree/v0.11/packages) has
several packages. Some of these packages are used by dApp developers and API
providers to interact with or to build Airnode. A few are simply used for
internal Airnode development.

- [airnode-adapter](/reference/airnode/v0.11/packages/adapter.md)
- [airnode-admin](/reference/airnode/v0.11/packages/admin-cli.md)
- [airnode-abi](/reference/airnode/v0.11/packages/airnode-abi.md)
- [airnode-deployer](/reference/airnode/v0.11/packages/deployer.md)

**Read about each package in the monorepo.**

Airnode packages are cross platform, available as npm packages or docker
containers. You should also be able to clone, build and use the packages on any
platform. However there is no guarantee that the development only features (e.g.
test or examples) will work out of the box. It is recommend to use UNIX based
systems for development. If you are using Windows, consider
[WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
