A dAPI is a live data point normally associated with human readable `dapiName`.
dAPI definitions simplify access and can return aggregated data feed values or a
single data feed value. This is suitable where the more recent data point
(meaning its set of data feeds could change as needed) is always more favorable,
e.g., in the context of an asset price data feed.
