[DapiServer.sol](./dapi-server-sol.md) will check that the requester has a
coverage policy for each dAPI it may attempt to read. See available dAPIs on the
[API3 Market➚](https://market.api3.org) which can be used to subscribe to a
dAPI. During the preview period, all dAPIs on production networks have free
access (limited time offer). See [Chains and Contracts](./chains.md), which
lists supported networks.
