# {{$frontmatter.title}}

There are three guides for QRNG. Each is a little different.

## QRNG Example Project

An example project that demonstrates the usage of the Airnode request–response
protocol to receive API3 QRNG services. This is a CLI based project found in the
[qrng-example](https://github.com/api3dao/qrng-example) repo. This project
presents a good overview on how to interact with QRNG. It also provides some
scripts that may be useful for things such as setting the QRNG parameters with a
requester (smart contract).

## Remix Example

This project is a simple and quick introduction to API3's QRNG service. Simply
follow the steps to see how a smart contract (known as a requester) can access
an on-chain quantum random number. You will use the browser based Remix IDE and
MetaMask. Some basic knowledge of these two tools is assumed.

## Youtube QRNG Access Guide

This is a more extensive guide that steps through a smart contract that actually
uses the quantum random number for an NFT.
