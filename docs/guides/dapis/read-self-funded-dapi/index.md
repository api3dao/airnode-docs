::: info Prerequisites

This section assumes that you have already deployed a self-funded dAPI proxy. If
you have not done so, please follow this guide on
[subscribing to self-funded dapis](/guides/dapis/subscribing-self-funded-dapis/index.md).

:::

dAPI proxies allows dAPIs to be used like libraries. Your smart contract just
need to import the interface for calling the proxy contract. To read a different
dAPI, your smart contract does not need to change the code itself, rather it
just needs to use a different proxy address when calling the `read()` function
on the proxy contract.

    address dapiProxy;

    function setDapiProxyAddress(address _proxyAddress) public onlyOwner {
        dapiProxy = _proxyAddress;
    }

    function readDapi public view returns (int224 value, uint32 timestamp) {
        return IDapiProxy(dapiProxy).read();
    }
}
```
