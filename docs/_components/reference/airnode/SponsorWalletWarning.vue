    <p>
      Sponsors should not fund a <code>sponsorWallet</code> with more then they
      can trust the Airnode with, as the Airnode controls the private key to the
      <code>sponsorWallet</code>. The deployer of such Airnode undertakes no
      custody obligations, and the risk of loss or misuse of any excess funds
      sent to the <code>sponsorWallet</code> remains with the sponsor.
