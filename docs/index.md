  tagline:
    dAPIs are continuously updated streams of off-chain data, such as the latest
    cryptocurrency, stock and commodity prices. They can power various
    decentralized applications such as DeFi lending, synthetic assets, stable
    coins, derivatives, NFTs and more. Airnode is a serverless oracle node
    implemented with a "set and forget" philosophy.
