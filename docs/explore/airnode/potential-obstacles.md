# {{$frontmatter.title}}

As a part of its previous efforts, API3 communicated with API providers extensively. 
We observed a number of obstacles that might prevent them from oracle onboarding 
and operation, the most important of which we have outlined below.

## Lack of familiarity

Traditional API providers are typically not more familiar with blockchain
technologies than the general public. This applies even for the ones that
curate cryptocurrency market data—as their main operation is collecting data
from exchange APIs, processing them, and serving the result through their own 
APIs—which does not require any blockchain-specific know-how. Therefore, they 
typically cannot readily operate an oracle node with in-house resources.

## The problem of node operators

There is no job market for oracle node operators. Even if some API provider 
were to obtain the specific know-how needed by hiring the few node operators 
that are available, this would not be a scalable solution.

Operating an oracle node consumes a lot of resources in the form of 
person-hours and infrastructure costs. Unless one is guaranteed significant 
subsidies or future profits, operating an oracle node is financially infeasible.

## Using cryptocurrencies

Operating an oracle node requires the API providers to transact with 
cryptocurrencies. Specifically, they must pay for gas costs in the native 
currency (e.g., ETH) and receive payments in one or more cryptocurrencies. 
This disqualifies the vast majority of API providers for compliance-related, 
legal and accounting reasons. In addition, any scheme that requires API 
providers to stake funds is categorically rejected for similar reasons 
related to financial risks.

## What about the advantages?

Although these potential barriers might seem off-putting at first, there are 
several compelling reasons for which it is still worth considering operating an 
oracle node. With first-party oracle nodes, there are, in fact, practical solutions 
to most of the issues above. Read more about them (in this article)["/explore/airnode/why-first-party-oracles.md"]
