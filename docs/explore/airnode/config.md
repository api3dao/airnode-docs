An Airnode is a first-party oracle that will push off-chain API data to any
on-chain requester. It is defined by a file named
[config.json](../reference/airnode/deployment-files/config-json.md/).

The diagrams below illustrate the required components to successfully deploy an
Airnode to AWS, GCP, or a Docker Container.

1. **config.json**: Contains the Airnode's configuration. The OIS object is
   important as it maps an API to Airnode endpoints.
2. **secrets.env**: Values that should not be exposed in config.json.
3. **aws.env**: AWS credentials required by the Docker deployer image.
4. **deployer image**: Deploys Airnode using its deploy command.
