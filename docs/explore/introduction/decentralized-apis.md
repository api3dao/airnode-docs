A dApp is an application that is implemented as a smart contract that runs on a
decentralized blockchain. By the same token, a dAPI is an on-chain API-like
service that is delivered to dApps. Just as applications use APIs, dApps will
use dAPIs.

dAPIs deliver quantifiably secure data feeds from curated sources to dApps.
Through a dAPI DeFi lenders, synthetic assets, algorithmic stablecoins or
derivatives (to name a few) can securely access continuously updated streams of
off-chain price reference data on-chain.

dAPIs are managed API services designed to resemble Web APIs for Web2 apps, but
from the perspective of a dApp. They have a standardized, user-friendly
interface that <!--intends to--> abstracts away the technical implementation and
can be composed of a variety of Airnode protocols. <!-- is this correct?-->

<!--These typically encompass Request-response Protocol (RRP), Publish-subscribe Protocol (PSP),
relayed RRP, relayed PSP and API-signed data.-->

<!-- Can we turn this paragraph into an asset

dAPIs are then delivered to builders from a variety of oracle services price
reference data for the latest cryptocurrency, stock and commodity prices.-->

### Understanding the dAPI Interface

dAPIs is an interface to connect to data feeds. They have been specifically
engineered for dApps to mimic the access of traditional Web APIs. dAPIs possess
a range of distinct attributes:

- dAPIs have a standardized, user-friendly interface that intends to abstract
  away the technical implementation.
- A dApp uses the dAPI interface to access data feed services. These services
  exist in a fully permissionless or authorized format.
- dAPIs exist entirely on-chain as smart contracts and use first-party oracles
  served in a variety of data feed services such as
  [self-funded or managed dAPIs](/reference/dapis/understand/proxy-contracts.md).
- In the future, and through a dAPI smart contract, developers can access
  additional services such as Service Coverage or Oracle Extractable Value.
  Currently these features are under development.

See the medium article about design decisions and dAPIs by reading
[dAPIs: APIs for dApps<ExternalLinkImage/>](https://medium.com/api3/dapis-apis-for-dapps-53b83f8d2493).

## dAPI Services

dAPIs have been designed to serve builders with data feeds that are appropiate
across the full application development cycle. As such, dAPIs are accessed in a
range of oracle services depending on product stage and use case. These consist
of:

1. Self-funded data feeds (single-source)
2. Managed data feeds (multi-source)

### Self-funded dAPIs

Self-funded dAPIs provide developers with the tools to use single-source data
feed services with no upfront commitment. They are served in a fully
permissionless fashion through the API3 Market. Once gas funds have been
provided in the oracle sponsor wallet a dAPI will begin automatically post data
on-chain when price deviation thresholds are met.

Self-funded data feeds are provided as an output of a single first-party oracle
that triggers price updates on-chain to a 1% deviation threshold. As such these
dAPIs are appropiate for early-stage of dApp development.

#### Activating a self-funded dAPI

To activate an oracle feed, users must deposit chain-native collateral to a
designated dAPI sponsor wallet. This collateral will cover the costs of gas for
oracle transactions.

<!--Self-funded data feeds are permissionless price reference dAPIs where collateral for an oracle update transaction is provided by the user. Self-funded dAPIs are activated by funding a gas wallet using the API3 Market.-->

<!--In cases where a single source is deemed insufficient or the overhead of keeping a wallet topped up for oracle services is undesirable, API3 recommends to utilize an ageeegated data feed.-->

API3 suggests using an aggregated data feed when a single source does not
provide enough reliability, or the costs associated with topping up your wallet
for oracle services are too prohibitive.

Follow the guide
[Subscribing to Self-Funded dAPIs](/guides/dapis/subscribing-self-funded-dapis/)
to understand how to fund a self-funded dAPI.

### Managed dAPIs

Managed dAPIs (currently under development) provide aggregated high-quality
price reference data served on-chain by first-party oracles. dAPIs provide DeFi
with a secure and transparent oracle solution that can be decentralized
according to user requirements.

Compared to self-funded dAPIs, managed dAPIs require user authorization through
the API3 Market. As such reading an aggregated data feed is permissioned,
meaning users need to register access to the dAPI. API3 will manage the gas fees
(using access fees charged) and maintain dAPIs as part of the managed service.

<!--higher-level? or user friendly?-->

<!--Compared to single sourced (byog) dAPIs, API3 and the underlying API providers will also take over the gas management overhead from this point onward until the
time that the service expires.-->

<!--### Service coverage

API3 provides dAPI users with a quantifiable level of security as on-chain
service coverage. Staked tokens in the DAO pool are used to cover potential
financial losses from dAPI malfunctions that the dAPI consumer might incur.

::: info Please note

Service coverage is not a live service and will be accessible in the future.

## Accessing dAPIs

<!--You access a dAPI through the API3 Market. This is a simple process by following the tools within API3 Market.-->

Accessing a dAPI via the
[API3 Market<ExternalLinkImage/>](https://market.api3.org/dapis) is easy and
requires only a few simple steps. Utilizing the tools available within the API3
Market, users can swiftly gain access to a dAPI with minimal effort.
