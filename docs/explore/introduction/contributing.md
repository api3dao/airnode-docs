# {{$frontmatter.title}}

We think critical infrastructure, like API3 DAO's first-party oracles, should
implement open and transparent contributor processes to align to our vision of
being a programmatically driven protocol.

To support DAO governance and inform voters, all teams publish a public proposal at regular
intervals, meaning strategy & operations are accessible on the
[API3 Governance Forum](https://forum.api3.org/) for all to understand.
Additionally, teams generally update the community with retrospective reports.

# API3 DAO welcomes community participation

Community participants within a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) have
an active role in shaping the future of the project. Our aim is to simplify the
process for those who wish to participate, providing predefined methods for
engagement. Generally these take forum in three routes:

1- Core team contributions 2- Completion of pre-defined bounties 3- New
initiatives or ideas

### Contributors can engage with proposals made by the core teams

If contributors feel they possess particular skills or expertise that may
benefit the proposal's execution, they can directly communicate with the
proposal leads. This collaborative approach encourages a diverse array of
viewpoints and fosters a proactive culture where everyone's skills and
experiences are leveraged for the benefit of the DAO's objectives.

### Take on pre-defined bounties

Community participants have the opportunity to engage with pre-set bounties,
organized in a modular structure to offer clear and attainable tasks. For
instance, a bounty might be created for a specific job that is expected to be
completed within two days. This structure allows any member of the community to
take on the job, complete it, and subsequently receive the designated grant as a
reward retrospectively.

Should participants wish to discuss the job before beginning, they are
encouraged to do so within the
[API3 Discord channel](https://discord.gg/qnRrcfnm5W), fostering an environment
of open communication and collaborative decision-making. Moreover, if members
have ideas for new bounty challenges, they are welcome to propose them, allowing
for a constant influx of fresh ideas and fostering a sense of ownership and
participation in the community's shared goals.

### Submit your own proposal

We welcome proposals that bring new ideas or sub-teams to the DAO. Generally
engaging the DAO through our community in a constructive manner will help
sentiment check a proposal and help shape it to align to current contributors.
If you are proposing an initiative that would require collaboration with a
current sub team, we suggest co-ordinating proactively and outlining how you
will work together.

# Propose ideas under the contributor framework

Individuals with a relevant background can contribute to the project in a
flexible manner, replicating similar freelancer/consultancy type figures commonly
seen.

For technical folks this could be through development, integrations, writing
documentation, etc.. Although the general challenge is that one needs to be able
to use a solution proficiently before being able to improve it. If this applies
we suggest digesting the get started materials.

To begin with, this contribution may look like:

- opening issues
- making pull requests
- proposing features

Marketers, creatives and community builders can contribute to DAO subteams with
ad-hoc projects or to support areas that are lacking focus. The challenge here
is accurately scoping, forming a brief proposed solution method, and then delivering 
in alignment with other involved contributors.

Regardless of the contributor's skill, API3's vision is for participation to be as
frictionless as possible. To support this, we provide the below framework as
modules for contributors to engage with. We appreciate the individual nature of
contribution and these frameworks are flexible, but we ask for those seeking to
support API3 DAO's proposed objectives.

<!-- please review the below -->


Prospective contributors should provide a clear scope of work with (1) detailed deliverables and estimations of completion time, (2) any applicable 
coordination with other contributors necessary to accomplish the deliverables, and (3) the amount of API3 tokens requested.

# Getting started

We recommend spending some time learning about API3 DAO's oracle technology
before looking to contribute from an engineer perspective. We welcome you to ask
any questions on [Discord<ExternalLinkImage/>](https://discord.gg/qnRrcfnm5W).

### Explore API3

- Read the
  [getting started<ExternalLinkImage/>](docs/explore/introduction/index.md)
  section in the API3 Docs
- (For the curious) Explore the API3 codebase on
  [GitHub<ExternalLinkImage/>](https://github.com/api3dao)
- If you do not have any blockchain development experience, read
  [Mastering Ethereum<ExternalLinkImage/>](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook)
  cover to cover. It is a light read that touches on all subjects that you will
  need to know about superficially.

**Technical contributors**

- Read the entirety of these docs. Take notes and cross-reference, but do not
  expect to understand everything. Feel free to ask questions.
- Visit the [API3 GitHub<externalLinkImage/>](https://github.com/api3dao) page
  and find everything about.. everything. Explore the many repositories to gain
  in-depth knowledge about API3.
- Go through the issues, PRs, etc. and understand the current focus of the
  development team by viewing the development board.

**Technical tutorials**

- Integrate an API to an Airnode (Run and understand the Airnode starter
  tutorial)
- Build a dApp that uses API3 QRNG
- Utilize API3 Price Feeds

### Engage

This page will be updated as more materials are produced. Please feel free to
create
[GitHub issues<ExternalLinkImage/>](https://github.com/api3dao/vitepress-docs/issues)
to make suggestions.
