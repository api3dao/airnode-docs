# {{$frontmatter.title}}

Read this page to learn more about contributing as a technical member to the
API3 DAO. Be sure to check out [Jobs](./jobs.md) page.

## Prerequisites

This is aimed to guide an API3 DAO member with a technical background to
contribute to the project (through development, integrations, writing
documentation, etc.). The general point is that one needs to be able to use a
solution proficiently before being able to improve it. Therefore, you are
recommended to do all of the below before attempting to contribute, and make
sure to ask any questions you have on
[Discord](https://discord.gg/qnRrcfnm5W)<ExternalLinkImage/>.

- If you do not have any blockchain development experience, read
  [Mastering Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook)<ExternalLinkImage/>
  cover to cover. It is a light read that touches on all subjects that you will
  need to know about superficially.

- To get a general grasp of the project, read the
  <a href="/api3-whitepaper-v1.0.3.pdf" target="_api3-whitepaper"> API3
  Whitepaper</a><ExternalLinkImage/> and our [Blog Posts on Medium](./blog.md).

- Read the entirety of these docs. Take notes and cross-reference, but do not
  expect to understand everything. Feel free to ask questions.

- Run and understand the Airnode starter tutorial

- (Optional, but ideal) Integrate an API to an Airnode without using any guide,
  deploy the Airnode, and build a dApp that uses the Airnode. Better yet, join
  one of our hackathons.

- (For the curious) Explore all the repos hosted on
  [GitHub](https://github.com/api3dao)<ExternalLinkImage/>, go through the
  issues, PRs, etc.

This guide will be updated as more materials are produced. Please feel free to
create [issues](https://github.com/api3dao/api3-docs/issues)<externalLinkImage/>
to make suggestions.

## Contributing to the Technical Documentation

See the [dev documentation](/dev/) for an overview of the API3 technical
documentation site. It contains instructions on the make-up of the docs and on
how to clone, setup, and run the project locally. For non-DAO members a PR from
a fork is always welcome.
