# API3 Market Oracle Tool

API3 has developed an oracle solution that enables smart contracts to access and
utilize valuable real-world data with ease. As such it is essential to make sure
the process of accessing this data is as user-friendly and efficient as
possible.

## Reading a dAPI

Smart contract developers access dAPIs through the
[API3 Market<ExternalLinkImage/>](https://market.api3.org), where data feeds are
easily searched, monitored, and consumed. Self-funded data feeds are accessible,
with managed data feeds to be launched in the near future.
