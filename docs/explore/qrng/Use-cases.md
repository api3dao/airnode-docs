# What can QRNG be used for?

API3 QRNG has seen dozens of applications utilize the oracle due to smart
contracts requiring a source of entropy to provide unpredictable outcomes. We
have seen a variety of use cases across on-chain applications.

### Gaming

In blockchain gaming, entropy is crucial for ensuring the randomness and
fairness of in-game events, such as character encounters, loot drops, and games
of chance.

### Whitelisting Processes

Entropy plays a significant role in the whitelisting process, particularly in
projects requiring fair and unbiased selection among applicants, such as early
access to services or special privileges.

### NFT Mints

In the realm of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), entropy is used to ensure the
equitable distribution of assets during minting processes. It also guarantees
that the allocation of rare and valuable NFTs is conducted in a manner that is
both random and fair.

### Lotteries

Entropy is fundamental to the operation of blockchain-based lotteries, where it
ensures that the selection of winners is entirely random and free from
interference.

### Other Use Cases
