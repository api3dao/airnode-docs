# {{$frontmatter.title}}

At the core, a **dAPI** is a mapping that points towards a **Beacon** or a **Beacon Set**, similarly to how an ENS name is mapped to an address. A Beacon is a point of data that is kept alive on-chain by a respective first-party oracle. It is addressed by an ID, which is derived from the hash of an Airnode address of a provider in combination with the request parameters. This resulting ID will always represent a specific provider with specific request parameters and cannot be changed. Following the same principle, a Beacon Set is addressed by an ID, which is derived from the hash of multiple Beacons, allowing for the creation of aggregations between multiple Beacons. The resulting ID of a Beacon Set also always represents the specific Beacons that make it up and cannot be changed. Values for Beacons or Beacon Sets are kept up to date on-chain on [DapiServer.sol](https://github.com/api3dao/airnode-protocol-v1/blob/main/contracts/dapis/DapiServer.sol)<externalLinkImage/>, where they can be read directly through `readDataFeedValueWithId`. 

API3 can, through the use of the function `setDapiName` associate an ID with a human-readable name like AVAX/USD. This allows to take over the management overhead that is associated with oracle infrastructure by e.g. creating a new Beacon Set if one first-party oracle becomes unavailable and pointing the name "AVAX/USD" towards the newly created ID. The benefit of this approach is that the dApps continue reading the same dAPI name through `readDataFeedWithDapiName` without being required to make any changes to their oracle specifications, effectively turning dAPIs into a turn-key data feed solution for them. dAPIs are available as either self-funded or managed data feed products.

## Self-Funded dAPIs

 Self-funded dAPIs are sourced from a single API provider and allow API3 to spin up any data on any chain without much overhead. Network fees for the self-funded dAPIs are paid from a respective sponsor wallet. Once funds are available on this wallet, updates on the associated dAPI will begin automatically (given the Airnode invocation restrictions). In the same way, the dAPI will stop being updated if the required funds for updates are not sufficiently available anymore. Sponsor wallets can be funded by anybody and the API3 Market is providing an intuative interface to check the status of respective self-funded dAPIs and fund them accordingly. Self-funded dAPIs provide developers with the tools to try out data feed services with minimal associated costs and no upfront commitment before committing to managed dAPIs. API3 does not recommend using self-funded dAPIs in a production environment. Read more in our security considerations. 

## Managed dAPIs

Self-funded dAPIs are sourced from a single API provider and allow API3 to spin up any data on any chain without much overhead. Network fees for the self-funded dAPIs are paid from a respective sponsor wallet. Once funds are available on this wallet, updates on the associated dAPI will begin automatically (given the Airnode invocation restrictions).

## API3 Market

The API3 Market is where all dAPIs, self-funded and managed alike, can be found. It represents a hub, that allows developers to browse through a catalogue of potential data feeds to integrate, fund their operation or pay for acquiring managed versions.

## `DapiServer.sol`

Developers use the
[DapiServer.sol](https://github.com/api3dao/airnode-protocol-v1/blob/main/contracts/dapis/DapiServer.sol)<externalLinkImage/>
contract to access dAPIs. `DapiServer.sol` reads directly from its data store of
Beacons, which are powered by API provider-owned and operated
[Airnodes](/reference/airnode/latest/).

A dAPI can be pointed towards an individual Beacon or an aggregation of
multiple Beacons (Beacon Set).

> <img src="../assets/images/dapi-beacons.png" width="550px"/>

Each dAPI has a human-readable name (e.g., `AVAX/USD`) that makes them easily
accessible using `DapiServer.sol` by simply passing the encoded bytes32 value of the
`dapiName` to a reader function.

```solidity
// Reading the AVAX/USD dAPI using the DapiServer contract
(value, timestamp) =
  IDapiServer(_dapiServerContractAddress).readDataFeedWithDapiName("0x415...0000");
```
