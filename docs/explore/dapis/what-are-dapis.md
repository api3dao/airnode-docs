# {{$frontmatter.title}}

A dAPI is a standardized interface that smart contracts can use to access data
feed services, that are continuously updated. These can range from the latest
cryptocurrency, forex, stock or commodity prices.

<!--They can power various decentralized applications such as DeFi
lending, synthetic assets, stable coins, derivatives, NFTs and more.-->

### Understanding dAPIs

dAPIs are composed of a Beacon or a set of Beacons, which are first-party data
feeds. A Beacon is directly powered and maintained on-chain by the owner of the
data, the API provider, which effectively removes third-party middlemen that
other oracle solutions rely on. This approach creates source transparency in
addition to, higher security, cost-efficiency and scalability through less
parties being involved in the oracle service operation.

### dAPIs connect smart contracts to first-party data feeds

Through the use of the function `setDapiName` API3 can associate the ID of a
Beacon or Beacon Set with a human-readable name like ETH/USD. The benefit of
this approach is that the dApps continue reading the same dAPI name through
`readDataFeedWithDapiName` without being required to make any changes to their
oracle specifications, effectively turning dAPIs into a turn-key data feed
solution for smart contract engineers.

At the core, a **dAPI** is a mapping that points towards a **Beacon** or a
**Beacon Set**, similarly to how an ENS name is mapped to a wallet address. The
ability to control this mapping allows the API3 DAO to take over the management
overhead that is associated with oracle infrastructure by e.g. creating a new
Beacon Set if one first-party oracle becomes unavailable and pointing the name
"AVAX/USD" towards the newly created ID.

### What is a Beacon or a Beacon Set?

A Beacon is a point of data that is kept alive on-chain by a respective
first-party oracle. It corresponds to an ID which is derived from the hash of
the Airnode address that is deployed by an API Provider, in combination with the
request parameters. This resulting ID will always represent a specific provider
with specific request parameters and cannot be changed.

Following the same principle, a Beacon Set is addressed by an ID, which is
derived from the hash of multiple Beacons. This allows for the creation of
aggregations between multiple Beacons. The resulting ID of a Beacon Set always
represents the specific Beacons that make it up and cannot be changed.

Values for Beacons or Beacon Sets are kept up to date on-chain on
[DapiServer.sol<externalLinkImage/>](https://github.com/api3dao/airnode-protocol-v1/blob/main/contracts/dapis/DapiServer.sol),
where they can be read directly through `readDataFeedValueWithId`.

# dAPI: A standardized interface

dAPIs possess a range of distinct attributes:

- dAPIs have a standardized, user-friendly interface that intends to abstract
  away the technical implementation.
- A dApp uses the dAPI interface to access data feed services. These services
  exist in a fully permissionless or authorized format.
- dAPIs exist entirely on-chain as smart contracts and use first-party oracles
  served in a variety of data feed services such as self-funded or managed dAPIs
  (more on this later).
- Through a dAPI smart contract, developers can access additional services such
  as Service Coverage or Oracle Extractable Value.

<!--## Why use dAPIs?

Due to being composed out of first-party data feeds, dAPIs offer security,
transparency, cost-efficiency and scalability in a turn-key package.

_Security_

Data used to update a first-party data feed is cryptographically signed by the
owner of the data. This means that the data that will update a feed cannot be
tampered with once it leaves the source. Furthermore, the API providers host a
first-party oracle node, Airnode, to push the data to the chain themselves. This
renders denial of service attacks by third parties ineffective.

_Transparency_

The cryptographic signatures prove that the data that updates a feed comes
directly from a specific API provider. Furthermore, Beacons that underpin dAPIs
allow the user to inspect what exact API endpoints are being called, and with
which parameters. This provides complete transparency to the dApp developer,
which is a big step from depending on a pseudonymous selection of third parties
that intentionally obscure their data sources.

_Cost-efficiency_

dAPIs are cost efficient compared to third-party data feeds, as the user does
not need to pay middlemen node operators for their services. Furthermore,
first-party data feeds do not require redundancy against middlemen layer
attacks. This makes single-Beacon dAPIs feasible, and allows API3 to provide a
wide variety of data feeds in a cost-efficient way.

_Scalability_

An inherently secure and cost-efficient data feed design allows API3 to build a
large number of dAPIs on many chains. This is supplemented by purpose-designed
Airnode protocols and relayer schemes to improve efficiency while not degrading
the security guarantees of a first-party data feed. The improved scalability of
dAPIs also factors into building aggregated data feeds. Since first-party data
feeds do not require redundancy at the middlemen layer, the aggregation costs
less gas and source-level decentralization becomes more affordable.-->

## API3Server.sol

A developer will deploy a proxy contract to access a dAPI. Through this proxy
developers use the
[API3Server.sol](https://github.com/api3dao/airnode-protocol-v1/blob/main/contracts/dapis/DapiServer.sol)<externalLinkImage/>
contract to access dAPIs. Now a developer can easily set the proxy contract
address in his contract and start reading from the dAPIs.

<img src="../assets/images/dAPI_explainer.png" style="width:500px">

The `API3ServerV1.sol` contract reads directly from its data store of Beacons,
which are powered by API provider-operated
[Airnodes](/reference/airnode/latest/). Thus proxies allow dAPIs to be used like
libraries. The smart contract only needs to import the interface for calling the
proxy contract.

This means once a dAPI is integrated to read a different data feed, the contract
does not need to change the code itself, rather it only needs to use a different
proxy address when calling the read() function on the proxy contract. If the
dAPI interface has previously been imported, it abstracts away the technical
implmentation of accessing new data feeds.

### Understanding the `API3ServerV1.sol`

A dAPI can be pointed towards an individual Beacon or an aggregation of multiple
Beacons (Beacon Set).

Each dAPI has a human-readable name (e.g., `AVAX/USD`) that makes them easily
accessible using `API3ServerV1.sol`. Simple pass the
[encoded bytes32 value](/reference/dapis/) of the `dapiName` to a reader
function.

```solidity
// Reading the AVAX/USD dAPI using the DapiServer contract
address proxy = "0x415...0000";
(value, timestamp) = IProxy(proxy).read();
```
