API3 is going to offer dAPIs as either self-funded or managed data feed products. Self-funded dAPIs are sourced from a single API provider and allow API3 to spin up any data on any chain without much overhead. Network fees for the self-funded dAPIs are paid from a respective sponsor wallet. Once this wallet has funds available, updates on the associated dAPI will begin automatically (given the Airnode invocation restrictions). Sponsor wallets can be funded by anybody and the API3 Market is providing an intuative interface to check the status of respective self-funded dAPIs and fund them accordingly. Self-funded dAPIs provide developers with the tools to try out data feed services with minimal associated costs and no upfront commitment.
