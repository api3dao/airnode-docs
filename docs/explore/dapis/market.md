Smart contract developers now have access to dAPIs through the new
[API3 Market](https://market.api3.org)<ExternalLinkImage/>, where data feeds are
easily searched, monitored, and consumed. For a limited time, dAPIs are free to
use. Projects can integrate now to maximize their access to high quality price
data during this free trial period. Visit the
[Request Data](https://forms.monday.com/forms/embed/f44d0ed9dfd0154885f48fdb3b87a489?r=use1)<ExternalLinkImage/>
form to get access.
