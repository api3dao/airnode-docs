This is suitable where the more recent data point (meaning its set of Beacons could change as needed) is always more favorable, e.g., in the context of an asset price data feed. Pass a dAPI name to the appropriate DapiServer.sol reader function. --- [readDataFeedWithDapiName(_dapiName)] (./functions/read-data-feed-with-dapi-name.html) - returns a value and timestamp --- [readDataFeedValueWithDapiName(_dapiName)] (./functions/read-data-feed-value-with-dapi-name.html) - returns a value solidity// Calling the ETH/USD dAPI using the DapiServer contract (value, timestamp) = IDapiServer(_dapiServerContractAddress).readDataFeedWithDapiName(&quot;ETH/USD&quot;);  1 2 3  Optionally, use Beacon and Beacon set IDs [#] (#optionally-use-beacon-and-beacon-set-ids)  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  It is possible to use a Beacon or Beacon set ID by calling [readDataFeedId()] (./functions/read-data-feed-with-id.html) and [readDataFeedValueById()] (./functions/read-data-feed-value-with-id.html) . Doing so is considered an advanced user flow. In practice reading with a name and reading with an ID are very different things. When you read with a name, you benefit from what the name maps to and how its value is aggregated from sourced Beacons. API3 manages dAPI name mappings to provide the best possible responses. When you read with an ID, you will always read a value directly from a Beacon or Beacon set. Also see [dAPI Composition] (/explore/dapis/what-are-dapis.html#dapi-composition) .
