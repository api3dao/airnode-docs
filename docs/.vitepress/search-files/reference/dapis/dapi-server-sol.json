All the related contracts can be imported from the [@api3/airnode-protocol-v1] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/@api3/airnode-protocol-v1) ‚ûö npm package. npm i @api3/airnode-protocol-v1  1 solidityimport &quot;@api3/airnode-protocol-v1/contracts/dapis/interfaces/IDapiServer.sol&quot;; contract mySmartContract { ... }  1 2 3 4 DapiServer.sol is a PSP requester contract. Unlike RRP, which is implemented as a central contract, PSP implementation is built into the requester for optimization. The primary purpose of DapiServer.sol is to return dAPI values to requesters. dAPIs are an abstraction layer over Beacons and Beacon sets. A Beacon is a live data feed addressed by an ID, which is derived from an Airnode address and a template ID. This is suitable where the more recent data point is always more favorable, e.g., in the context of an asset price data feed. Beacons can also be seen as one-Airnode data feeds that can be used individually or combined to build Beacon sets. Visit the [Guides] (/guides/dapis/) section to learn how to use DapiServer.sol. Also visit the function calls of DapiServer.sol shown below. --- [readDataFeedWithDapiName()] (./functions/read-data-feed-with-dapi-name.html) - Returns a value and timestamp using the dAPI name. --- [readDataFeedValueWithDapiName()] (./functions/read-data-feed-value-with-dapi-name.html) - Returns a value using the dAPI name. --- [readDataFeedWithId()] (./functions/read-data-feed-with-id.html) - Returns a value and timestamp using a Beacon or Beacon set ID. --- [readDataFeedValueWithId()] (./functions/read-data-feed-value-with-id.html) - Returns a value using a Beacon or Beacon set ID. --- [readerCanReadDataFeed()] (./functions/reader-can-read-datafeed.html) - Whether a reader can read a dAPI, Beacon, or Beacon set. --- [dataFeedIdToReaderToWhitelistStatus()] (./functions/data-feed-id-to-reader-to-whitelist-status.html) Details about the coverage policy status of a reader address for a dAPI, Beacon, or Beacon set.
