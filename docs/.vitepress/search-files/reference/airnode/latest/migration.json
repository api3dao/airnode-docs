Also this is an older migration guide for v0.8. The following guide assumes a valid v0.8.x config.json file. All changes listed below will need to be implemented in order to migrate to Airnode v0.9.0. This document is written in a way that will preserve existing behaviour with earlier Airnode versions. The document also mentions changes of the user facing services related to Airnode, such as airnode-deployer, airnode-admin and more.  Summary [#] (#summary)  ---  ois[n].oisFormat updated to &quot;1.2.0&quot;. nodeSettings.nodeVersion updated to &quot;0.9.0&quot;. airnode-deployer remove-with-deployment-details now accepts a full --airnode-address argument instead of the short airnode address (--airnode-address-short). We recommend using Sepolia and Goerli testnets instead of Rinkeby, Ropsten, and Kovan.

The only user facing change is that the deployer uses the full Airnode address instead of the shortened one when executing the remove-with-deployment-details command. diff- docker run -it --rm \\ - -v &quot;$(pwd):/app/config&quot; \\ - api3/airnode-deployer:0.8.0 remove-with-deployment-details \\ - --airnode-address-short abd9eaa \\ - --stage dev \\ - --cloud-provider gcp \\ - --projectId myAirnode101 \\ ‚Üê GCP only - --region us-east1 + docker run -it --rm \\ + -v &quot;$(pwd):/app/config&quot; \\ + api3/airnode-deployer:0.9.0 remove-with-deployment-details \\ + --airnode-address 0xabd9eaa588B6818Ac4C32c5e9b31962E351Cd39F \\ + --stage dev \\ + --cloud-provider gcp \\ + --projectId myAirnode101 \\ ‚Üê GCP only + --region us-east1  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 4--Recommended testnets to use are now Sepolia and Goerli The Rinkeby, Ropsten, and Kovan testnets have been deprecated and will be removed.
