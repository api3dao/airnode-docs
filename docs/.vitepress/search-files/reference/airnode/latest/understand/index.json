But first, see the [Quick Deploy] (./../../tutorial/README.html) demos to get a simple understanding of an Airnode deployment. The demos [Quick Deploy AWS] (./../../tutorial/quick-deploy-aws/) and [Quick Deploy GCP] (./../../tutorial/quick-deploy-gcp/) each have preconfigured downloadable project folders with files for a typical deployment. This guide primarily focuses on a deployment to AWS but describes changes that are needed for GCP deployments when encountered.  Project Folder [#] (#project-folder)  --  Create a folder called /my-airnode. Add the files config.json, secrets.env, and aws.env to this folder as shown below. Optionally add gcp.json if you intend to deploy to GCP as well. my-airnode â”œâ”€â”€ aws.env &lt;- For AWS deployment â”œâ”€â”€ gcp.json &lt;- Optional for GCP deployment â”œâ”€â”€ config.json â””â”€â”€ secrets.env  1 2 3 4 5 This guide will explain the content of the configuration files and run the deployment within this project folder. Use the files in the [Templates] (./../../../reference/templates/config-json.html) section of the docs to get a jump start if you are new to Airnode. Also consider the [Quick Deploy Demos] (./../../tutorial/) if you are new to Airnode before using this guide.  Configuration [#] (#configuration)    The main focus while creating an Airnode is the preparation of three files (two for GCP) that both define and support its creation. ---config.json: Defines the Airnode and its behavior. ---secrets.env: Hold secrets referenced by config.json using interpolation. ---aws.env: Holds the AWS credentials used by the Docker deployer image to deploy the Airnode to AWS. ---gcp.json: (GCP) only) Holds the GCP project ID and associated information used by the Docker deployer image to deploy the Airnode to GCP.  Deployment [#] (#deployment)  ----  Last is the deployment. There are two ways to run the Airnode. The most popular is with a cloud provider like AWS or GCP. You would use the Docker [Airnode Deployer Image] (./../docker/../../docker/deployer-image.html) for this type of deployment. This guide will use the deployer image. The second method is to run a containerized Airnode hosted internally or with a cloud provider service (e.g. AWS EC2 or Lightsail). Use the Docker [Airnode Client Image] (./../../docker/client-image.html) for this type of deployment.  More...
