These values are endpointId/address pairs that Airnode uses to allow access to its endpoints by requesters (smart contracts). Blockchain experience is not needed to use authorizations as Airnode performs these validations internally (off-chain). Nothing in [Authorizers] (./authorizers.html) can supersede permissions granted by authorizations as the latter takes precedence. The diagram below illustrates how Airnode utilizes authorizations. ![image] (/assets/concepts-authorizations.05de189e.png) 1-- When Airnode starts it reads its list of authorizations (endpointId/address pairs) declared in config.json. 2-- Airnode validates each request, checking that the requested endpoint and address of the requester is in fact in authorizations as a valid endpointId/address pair. For requests that are validated, Airnode proceeds to fulfill the request.  Are authorizations required? [#] (#are-authorizations-required)  ----  Authorizations are not required. An Airnode operator could use [Authorizers] (./authorizers.html) or [Relayed Meta Data] (./relay-meta-auth.html) . It is possible to use both authorizers and relay security schemes together.  Why is an authorizations scheme needed? [#] (#why-is-an-authorizations-scheme-needed)  -  Airnodes need the ability to fulfill requests selectively. This is required for two main reasons: 1--The Airnode only fulfills requests made by requesters who have made payment to the Airnode owner wishes, which allows them to monetize their services. 2--The Airnode owner only allows requester contracts it owns access to certain endpoints. 3--The services of the Airnode are sensitive and can only be accessed by certain requesters, e.g., who have gone through KYC. A protocol that does not have the authorizations scheme or equivalent functionality cannot be considered as permissionless, and will not be able to achieve wide-spread adoption. Currently there is only one authorization scheme type, see [requesterEndpointAuthorizations] (https://github.com/api3dao/airnode/blob/master/packages/airnode-validator/src/config/config.ts#L162) . The authorizations scheme type is set in chains[n].authorizations.{&lt;authorizationsSchemeType&gt;} of config.json. jsonchains[n].authorizations:{requesterEndpointAuthorizers:{}},  1  requesterEndpointAuthorizations [#] (#requesterendpointauthorizations)  -  Currently requesterEndpointAuthorizations is the only scheme type available for authorizations. It defines a list of endpointIds each with an array of requester addresses that can access them. json{ ... &quot;chains&quot;:[ { &quot;id&quot;: &quot;1&quot;, ... &quot;authorizers&quot;: { The scheme type requesterEndpointAuthorizations }, grants access to endpointId/address pairs &quot;authorizations&quot;: { â¬‡ï¸Ž &quot;requesterEndpointAuthorizations&quot;: { &quot;0x6db9...7af6&quot;: [&quot;0xdhrt...A498&quot;], &quot;0x8dd9...5ad7&quot;: [&quot;0xdhrt...A498&quot;, &quot;0xcse0...D236&quot;], â¬†ï¸Ž â¬†ï¸Ž â¬†ï¸Ž endpointId requester addresses } }, }, }  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18  More reading...
