These can be defined in the config.json. The supported strategies include: ---latestBlockPercentileGasPrice ---providerRecommendedGasPrice ---providerRecommendedEip1559GasPrice ---constantGasPrice The strategies are attempted in the order that they are defined in config.json where the Airnode will move on to the next strategy in the list if the current fails. The only required strategy to be included is constantGasPrice which is intended to be used as the final fallback if all other strategies fail to return a gas price. Therefore, constantGasPrice should be set as the last strategy in the list.  latestBlockPercentileGasPrice [#] (#latestblockpercentilegasprice)  --  The latestBlockPercentileGasPrice strategy calculates a gas price based on the specified percentile of previous transactions in recent blocks and sets the transaction to type 0 and a gasPrice value. The parameters that the strategy uses to calculate the gas price can be configured. json{ &quot;gasPriceStrategy&quot;: &quot;latestBlockPercentileGasPrice&quot;, &quot;percentile&quot;: 60, &quot;minTransactionCount&quot;: 20, &quot;pastToCompareInBlocks&quot;: 20, &quot;maxDeviationMultiplier&quot;: 2 }  1 2 3 4 5 6 7  percentile [#] (#percentile)   (required) - The percentile of gas prices to return from a block.  minTransactionCount [#] (#mintransactioncount)   (required) - The minimum amount of transactions required in a block to use for calculating a gas price percentile.  pastToCompareInBlocks [#] (#pasttocompareinblocks)   (required) - The number of blocks to look back for the reference block.  maxDeviationMultiplier [#] (#maxdeviationmultiplier)   (required) - The maximum deviation multiplier of the latest block gas price percentile compared to the reference block gas price percentile. Used to protect against large gas price spikes.  providerRecommendedGasPrice [#] (#providerrecommendedgasprice)  ---  The providerRecommendedGasPrice strategy gets a gas price estimate from the provider, applies the defined multiplier to it and sets the transaction totype 0 and a gasPrice value. json{ &quot;gasPriceStrategy&quot;: &quot;providerRecommendedGasPrice&quot;, &quot;recommendedGasPriceMultiplier&quot;: 1.2 }  1 2 3 4  recommendedGasPriceMultiplier [#] (#recommendedgaspricemultiplier)   (required) - A number with a maximum of two decimals that gets multiplied by the provider reported gas price. The resulting Gas Price will equal Gas Price * providerRecommendedGasPrice.  providerRecommendedEip1559GasPrice [#] (#providerrecommendedeip1559gasprice)  --  The providerRecommendedEip1559GasPrice strategy gets an EIP1559 fee data estimate from the provider and applies the configured baseFeeMultiplier and priorityFee values returning a type 2 transaction with maxFeePerGas and maxPriorityFeePerGas values. json{ &quot;gasPriceStrategy&quot;: &quot;providerRecommendedEip1559GasPrice&quot;, &quot;baseFeeMultiplier&quot;: 2, &quot;priorityFee&quot;: { &quot;value&quot;: 3.12, &quot;unit&quot;: &quot;gwei&quot; } }  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  baseFeeMultiplier [#] (#basefeemultiplier)   (required) - Number multiplied by the Base Fee to yield the Maximum Fee for EIP-1559 transactions. Defaults to: 2. The resulting Maximum Fee will equal (Base Fee * baseFeeMultiplier) + priorityFee.  priorityFee [#] (#priorityfee)   (required) - An object that configures the EIP-1559 Priority Fee. Defaults: {&quot;value&quot;: 3.12, &quot;unit&quot;: &quot;gwei&quot;}.  priorityFee.value [#] (#priorityfee-value)   (required) - A number specifying the EIP-1559 priority fee value.  priorityFee.unit [#] (#priorityfee-unit)   (required) - The unit of the priority fee value. It can be one of the following: (wei, kwei, mwei, gwei, szabo, finney, ether).  constantGasPrice [#] (#constantgasprice)  -  The constantGasPrice strategy returns a type 0 gas price with the configured gasPrice value. This strategy is intended to be used as a fallback in the case that the other strategies fail to return a gas price. json{ &quot;gasPriceStrategy&quot;: &quot;constantGasPrice&quot;, &quot;gasPrice&quot;: { &quot;value&quot;: 10, &quot;unit&quot;: &quot;gwei&quot; } }  1 2 3 4 5 6 7  gasPrice [#] (#gasprice)   (required) - An object of the form {&quot;value&quot;: 0, &quot;unit&quot;: &quot;wei&quot;} that configures the amount to use as gas price.  gasPrice.value [#] (#gasprice-value)   (required) - A number specifying the gasPrice value.  gasPrice.unit [#] (#gasprice-unit)   (required) The unit of the gasPrice value. It can be one of the following: (wei, kwei, mwei, gwei, szabo, finney, ether).
