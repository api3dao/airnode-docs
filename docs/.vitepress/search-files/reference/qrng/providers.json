See below for the providers that are currently available. Each provider has an Airnode address with an extended public key (xpub)) and two endpoint IDs. airnode: The address that belongs to the Airnode that will be called to get the QRNG data via its endpoints. This is not AirnodeRrpV0 contract address. xpub: The extended public key of the Airnode (airnode). endpointIdUint256: The Airnode endpoint ID that returns one random number of type uint256. endpointIdUint256Array: The Airnode endpoint ID that returns multiple random numbers of type uint256[]. Takes one parameter named size of type uint256 (maximum value: 1024).
