The Airnode is defined by a file named [config.json] (/reference/airnode/latest/deployment-files/config-json.html) . Airnode is also the backbone that feeds data to beacons. Beacons are the behind the scene components that supply on-chain dAPIs with data. The diagrams below illustrate the required configuration files to successfully deploy an Airnode to AWS, GCP, or a Docker Container. @tab:AWS ![image] (/assets/api-provider-overview-aws.bf454c50.png) 1--config.json: Contains the Airnode&#39;s configuration. The OIS object is important as it maps an API to Airnode endpoints. 2--secrets.env: Values that should not be exposed in config.json. 3--aws.env: AWS credentials required by the Docker deployer image. 4--deployer image: Deploys Airnode using its deploy command. @tab:GCP ![image] (/assets/api-provider-overview-gcp.95e28555.png) 1--config.json: Contains the Airnode&#39;s configuration. The OIS object is important as it maps an API to Airnode endpoints. 2--secrets.env: Values that should not be exposed in config.json. 3--deployer image: Deploys Airnode using its deploy command. @tab:Container ![image] (/assets/api-provider-overview-container.c5e8d7bd.png) 1--config.json: Contains the Airnode&#39;s configuration.
