Be sure to check out [Jobs] (./jobs.html) page.  Prerequisites [#] (#prerequisites)    This is aimed to guide an API3 DAO member with a technical background to contribute to the project (through development, integrations, writing documentation, etc.). The general point is that one needs to be able to use a solution proficiently before being able to improve it. Therefore, you are recommended to do all of the below before attempting to contribute, and make sure to ask any questions you have on [Discord] (https://discord.gg/qnRrcfnm5W) âžš . If you do not have any blockchain development experience, read [Mastering Ethereum] (https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook) âžš cover to cover. It is a light read that touches on all subjects that you will need to know about superficially. To get a general grasp of the project, read the [ API3 Whitepaper] (/api3-whitepaper-v1.0.3.pdf) âžš and our [Blog Posts on Medium] (./blog.html) . Read the entirety of these docs. Take notes and cross-reference, but do not expect to understand everything. Feel free to ask questions. Run and understand the Airnode starter tutorial (Optional, but ideal) Integrate an API to an Airnode without using any guide, deploy the Airnode, and build a dApp that uses the Airnode. Better yet, join one of our hackathons. (For the curious) Explore all the repos hosted on [GitHub] (https://github.com/api3dao) âžš , go through the issues, PRs, etc. This guide will be updated as more materials are produced. Please feel free to create [issues] (https://github.com/api3dao/api3-docs/issues) âžš to make suggestions.  Contributing to the Technical Documentation [#] (#contributing-to-the-technical-documentation)    See the [dev documentation] (/dev/) for an overview of the API3 technical documentation site. It contains instructions on the make-up of the docs and on how to clone, setup, and run the project locally. For non-DAO members a PR from a fork is always welcome.
