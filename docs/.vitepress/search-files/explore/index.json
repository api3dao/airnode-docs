[#] (#frontmatter-title)  ====  API3 ( [https://api3.org] (https://api3.org) âžš ) is a collaborative project to deliver traditional API services to smart contract platforms in a decentralized and trust-minimized way. It is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), namely the API3 DAO. Therefore, its code is open source and its operations are transparent. Learn more about API3 on its website. API3 Whitepaper (pdf) For a detailed discussion of the API3 project, read the [API3 Whitepaper] (/api3-whitepaper-v1.0.3.pdf) .  Thesis Statement [#] (#thesis-statement)  -  The vast majority of the external integrations that decentralized applications need are to commercial Web APIs that traditional businesses have built to monetize their data and services. Therefore, what is widely known as the oracle problem is in practice an API connectivity problem. Existing oracle solutions fall short because they fail to make this distinction, resulting in inferior solutions that depend on third-party oracles and ecosystems that exclude API providers. By refining the definition of the problem, API3 aims to provide a much more optimal solution and introduces Airnode, a first-party oracle.

Generic oracle solutions fail to appropriately address the API connectivity problem due to an over-generalized and misguided approach. To remedy this issue, API3 will drive a collaborative effort to create first-party oracles and a new generation of blockchain-native, decentralized APIs, or dAPIs for short.  Airnode [#] (#airnode)  ---  At its core, API3 brings the ability for API providers to easily run their own first-party oracle nodes. This allows them to provide their data on-chain, without an intermediary, to any decentralized app (dApp) interested in their services. At the heart of this mechanism sits [Airnode] (./airnode/what-is-airnode.html) , an open-source first-party oracle node. It&#39;s designed to be easily deployed by any API provider with almost no maintenance. Because of Airnode, dApp developers can write smart contracts to interact with the on-chain data of API providers. Airnode is designed with mechanisms to remove the on-chain or off-chain concerns of API providers. The set-and-forget framework of Airnode is all about ease of implementation.  dAPIs [#] (#dapis)  ----  [dAPIs] (./dapis/what-are-dapis.html) are composed of first-party oracles operated by API providers, and thus are more secure and cost-efficient than alternative solutions that employ middlemen. At the core of the governance, security, and value capture mechanics of this initiative will be the API3 token. Staking the token will grant its holders full governing rights over the API3 DAO along with all the associated rewards. Staked API3 tokens will be used as collateral for the on-chain coverage service that will provide quantifiable and trustless security guarantees to dAPI users. These mechanics will remove the need for a central authority at the ecosystem level. As a result, the API3 Project will allow smart contract platforms to leverage APIs for the building of meaningful applications in a truly decentralized and trust-minimized way.
