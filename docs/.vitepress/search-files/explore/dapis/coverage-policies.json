It should speak to subscriptions or coverage policies or whtever they are called by hte time the API3 Market is ready. DapiServer.sol will check that the requester has a coverage policy for each dAPI it may attempt to read. See available dAPIs on the [API3 Market] (https://market.api3.org) ‚ûö . During the preview period, all dAPIs on production networks have free access (limited time offer). Please go to the [Request Data] (https://forms.monday.com/forms/embed/f44d0ed9dfd0154885f48fdb3b87a489?r=use1) ‚ûö page to request dAPI access on production networks. See [Chains and Contracts] (/reference/dapis/chains.html) , which includes supported networks. On the Polygon Mumbai testnet, developers can self-enable the use of any dAPI. During the deployment flow of your smart contract that reads a data feed, add code that self-enables the desired dAPI. The following scripts from the [Starter Project] (https://github.com/api3dao/data-feed-reader-example) ‚ûö detail how this is done.
