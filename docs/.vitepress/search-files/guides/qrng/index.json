QRNG Example Project [#] (#qrng-example-project)  ----  An example project that demonstrates the usage of the Airnode requestâ€“response protocol to receive API3 QRNG services. This is a CLI based project found in the [qrng-example] (https://github.com/api3dao/qrng-example) repo. This project presents a good overview on how to interact with QRNG. It also provides some scripts that may be useful for things such as setting the QRNG parameters with a requester (smart contract).  Remix Example [#] (#remix-example)    This project is a simple and quick introduction to API3&#39;s QRNG service. Simply follow the steps to see how a smart contract (known as a requester) can access an on-chain quantum random number. You will use the browser based Remix IDE and MetaMask. Some basic knowledge of these two tools is assumed.  Youtube QRNG Access Guide [#] (#youtube-qrng-access-guide)  ----  This is a more extensive guide that steps through a smart contract that actually uses the quantum random number for an NFT.
