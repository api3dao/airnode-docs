Rewards will increase to incentivize staking when the pool runs low and decrease to reduce token emissions when the pool is well funded. To see the current funding status, you can see the percentage of target met which is calculated by the total amount staked divided by the staking target.  Unstake and Claim [#] (#unstake-and-claim)  ---  Unstake tokens and claims rewards. To incentivize governance responsibilities and protect the DAO&#39;s long term interest, rewards are locked for one year.
